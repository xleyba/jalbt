# JALBT 

This is a try to create Bit Torrent client just to get skills on Rust language while learning.
I decided to do it because it seems to have all the topics that I would like to learn: 

- file management
- networking including http, tcp and udp
- client/server
- async communication
- multithreading

The idea is to do everything by myself and avoid the use of crates as far as possible.
